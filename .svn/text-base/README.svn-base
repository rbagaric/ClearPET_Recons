Installation of the ClearPET reconstruction software
----------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the sources for the ClearPET reconstruction software.
The software is based on the STIR library, extended by some ClearPET specific
programs and a user interface based on HTML.

Unless otherwise noted, the instructions in this file expect that you
are logged in as root users, and that the current working directory
is set to the folder where this readme file is located.

WARNING: the installation of this software is a complex process.
It should only be made by system administrators.
We recommend that you read this document completely before installation,
then follow the steps in this file.


1. Requirements:
----------------
The software requires a Linux system. Remember that the reconstruction
requires a lot of calculations, so better use a fast machine.

The following packages must be installed prior to the installation of the
ClearPET reconstruction software:
- apache2
- apache2-mod_perl
- perl (at least version 5.6)
- boost-devel
On SuSE-Linux systems, the following package is also recommended:
- yast2-http-server
All these packages should be part of your Linux distribution.


2. Basic configuration
----------------------
Most parts of the ClearPET reconstruction use a central configuration
file. This must must be named /etc/clearpet.conf.
 A basic version of this file is located in the etc folder of this archive.
Just copy it to /etc and edit it to the needs of your local configuration.
The comments in the file should be helping you. Especially check the
sections marked with "TODO".

Be sure that this file is readable by everybody, but only writeable by
the root user. The parameters in this file are critical for the correct
operation of the reconstruction software.
  
All this can be done using the commands:
  cp etc/clearpet.conf /etc
  chown root.users /etc/clearpet.conf
  chmod 644 /etc/clearpet.conf

2.1 Local or remote data folders
--------------------------------
One problem with the ClearPET system is that the measured data
are first stored on up to 6 different machines: a master and up to 5
preprocessors. All these data are needed during reconstruction.
There are two ways to handle this:
- copy the files manually to the reconstruction server
- load them via network during reconstruction

 The first approach requires manual interaction on 6 machines, and
a lot of disk space on the reconstruction server. However, the
reconstruction runs faster after the data have been copied, and
the basic setup is quite simple.
 The second approach requires some complicated setup, but then it
works without user interaction. The reconstruction process is
slowed by the network transport, but it is faster in overall as
long as the data are not needed more than once.

You must specify the location of data in the clearpet.conf file 
with the parameter "DataFrom". Set it to "SinglesFromLocal"
for local folders, or to "SinglesFromPrepros" for remote
folders.

2.1.1 Setup for local folders
-----------------------------
In order to use a local data folder, you must provide a folder
on a large partition where users can copy the measured data to.
In addition, this folder needs write access by the clearpet user.
Usually, this folder would be a Samba share on the local machine,
which requires that a Samba server is installed.

In the clearpet.conf file, you must specify the name of this
folder in the "DataRoot" parameter.

2.1.2 Setup for remote folders
--------------------- --------
In order to use remote folders, the other PCs (Master and
preprocessors must export their data folders as network shares.
You also need a local user on those machines who is allowed to
modify the data folders.
 On the Linux machines, those shares are mounted using the CIFS
file system. To mount them, you need the host names, the names
of the shares and the mount points in the local file system. We
want to mount those shares temporarily as clearpet user.
Therefore, the mount points (just empty directories) must be
owned by the clearpet user.
In addition, you need an entry in the /etc/fstab file for each
of the shares. Such an entry looks like:
  //HOST/SHARE MOUNTPOINT cifs user,noauto,rw,suid,user=USER,password=PASSWORD,uid=clearpet,gid=users
You need to replace HOST, SHARE, MOUNTPOINT, USER and PASSWORD
by the host name of the remote PC, the name of the share, the
local mount points, the remote user and password, respectively.

In order to tell the reconstruction programs where the data are
located, you need to enter the share names and mountpoints in
the /etc/clearpet.conf file. Look into that file at the comments
near the parameter "ShareMaster".


3. The clearpet user
--------------------
The ClearPET reconstruction system expects to have a user called
"clearpet" on the system, who has a home directory containing all
the requried programs and documents which are not part of the HTTP
interface.
 Typically, the clearpet user never needs to be logged in. However,
a login might be required in case of problems.

3.1 Create the clearpet user
----------------------------
 You create this user with the command
   useradd -m clearpet
 This should also create a folder /home/clearpet. Be sure to set
a password for the clearpet user, using the command
  passwd clearpet

3.2 Create the clearpet folder structure
----------------------------------------
The basic configuration expects some folders where files are saved.
These folders usually are located in the clearpet home directory.

Now, switch to the clearpet user and create the folders using the
commands:
  su clearpet
  cd /home/clearpet
  mkdir bin
  mkdir Status
  mkdir Master MasterWWW
  mkdir Prepro1 Prepro2 Prepro3 Prepro4 Prepro5
The last 7 folders (Master, MasterWWW, PrePro1 .. Prepro5) are only
needed if you will be loading your raw data files directly from the
preprocessors. They are the mount places for the CIFS shares
exported by the preprocessors.

The system also needs some parameter files. Those can be found in the
folder Params in archive. Copy them with the command
  cp -R ARCHIVE/Params .
where "ARCHIVE" must be replaced by the name of the folder where this
readme file is located.

The "Status" folder must be accessible by the web server, same as
the folder MasterWWW if it has been created. To do that, switch back
to root and change the group access by:
  exit
  chgrp www Status MasterWWW
  chmod 775 Status MasterWWW
Note: if the chgrp command produdes an error message, then check the
group name of the Apache server in the Apache configuration.


4. Setup of the HTTP server:
----------------------------
After installation of the apache2 package, the server should have a basic
configuration which works. Most probably, the server must be started directly
after installation, usually by root using the command
	rcapache2 start
Using the system configuration (e.g. yast), the server should be configured
to be started automatically when booting the system. Be sure that the
server is listening on port 80 of your LAN interface(s).

Do not try to use the HTTP interface until all configurations are made.
You will just get some errors until everything is put together correctly.

4.1 Copying the HTML files and scripts
--------------------------------------
The user interface of the ClearPET reconstruction is made of some HTML
documents and some Perl scripts which are used by them. These documents
can be found in the HTPP folder of the archive.
 Copy all files in the HTPP folder to the htdocs folder of your apache2
server (usually /srv/www/htdocs). Then change ownership of these files
to the www user and group. Use these commands:
  cp HTTP/* /srv/www/htdocs
  chown wwwrun.www /srv/www/htdocs/*
Note: the user and group names for the web server might be different on
your system. If the line above produces an error message like "invalid user",
then check your Apache configuration files for the correct naems.

Note: If you are using an exisiting Apache installation, the lines above
might conflict with existing files (especially index.html). In such a
case is it recommended to install the ClearPET files into a subfolder,
like:
  mkdir /srv/www/htdocs/ClearPET
  cp HTTP/* /srv/www/htdocs/ClearPET
  chown -R wwwrun.www /srv/wa login/htdocs/ClearPET

4.2 Configuring the ClearPET HTML interface
-------------------------------------------
The HTML documents need some configuration to work correctly. A basic
configuration can be found in the folder HTTP_conf of the archive.
Copy the file clearpet_http.conf to the folder /etc/apache2/conf.d
and edit the file to your needs using your favorite text editor.

You might need to change the follwing entries:
- The directory name "/srv/www/htdocs" needs to be changed to the
 location where you installed the ClearPET HTML documents.
- You might want to change the access control to limit the access
 to your local subnet or to some hosts. The default allows access
 from everywhere.
- You might want to remove (better: comment with # character) the
 lines "AuthType Basic" until "require valid-user", if you do not
 want to have a password protection on the interface.

After saving this file, the HTTP server needs to be reloaded using
the command
  rcapache2 reload

4.3 Changing the password of the clearpet user
----------------------------------------------
The basic setup protects the access to the reconstruction interface
with a password. The preconfigured access is user "clearpet" with
password "clearpet". You should change this password using the command
  htpasswd2 /home/clearpet/http_passwd clearpet
Of course, you can also add new users here. Just type "htpasswd2"
to get a help on this program.
 Note that the clearpet user password of the HTTP interface is not 
the same as the password of the clearpet user described in chapter 3.
 The ClearPET HTTP configuration expected the password file to be
located at /home/clearpet/http_passwd. If you prefer a different
location, don't forget to adjust the HTTP configuration.
 The password file should be accessible by user clearpet and the
HTTP server, but nobody else. To do that, use the commands:
  chown clearpet.www http_passwd
  chmod 640 http_passwd

4.4 Test the interface
----------------------
You can now make a first test of the interface. Start a HTTP browser
on this machine and type "http://localhost". It should first prompt
with a password dialog. After typing the user name "clearpet" and
the password it should display the ClearPET reconstruction home page.
You can select other pages using the links in the menu, but please
do not submit any forms yet. The cannot work until the installation
is complete.


5. Install the scripts
----------------------
The reconstructuion process is controlled by some Perl scripts, which
call the binary programs which do the bulk of the work. Theses
scripts are expected to be located in /home/clearpet/scripts. You copy
them with the command
  sudo -u clearpet cp -r scripts /home/clearpet
In addition, we need a version of kill which allows the www user
to terminate reconstruction processes. We install this using the
commands:
  cp /bin/kill /home/clearpet/bin
  chown clearpet.users /home/clearpet/bin/kill
  chmod +s /home/clearpet/bin/kill

6. Install the binaries
-----------------------
Compiling the binaries takes some time. It is required because
raytest cannot know the type of system you have.

6.1 Compile the binaries
------------------------
Goto the "src" folder of the archive. There are 3 packages to be
compiled: CoincSort, LMF 2.0, and STIR. We compile them in this
order:
  cd src
  cd CoinSort
  make
  cd ../lmf_v2.0
  ./configure
  make
  cd ../STIR
  make
  cd ..
During the compilations, especially of the STIR package, you will
get lots of warnings. You can ignore them.

If all the compilations have compeleted successfully (you can check
that by calling make again), you need to install the binaries.

6.2 Install the binaries
------------------------
Finally, the binaries need to be installed into the bin folder of
the clearpet user. To do that, we switch to the clearpet user
and run the "make install" commands:
  su clearpet
  cd CoincSort
  make install
  cd ../STIR
  make install
  exit


7. Install the scheduler
------------------------
The HTTP interface requires a scheduler to be running in background.
This scheduler watches the Status folder and checks any incoming parameter
files in this folder, which are written by the scripts of the HTTP
interface. Then it starts the scripts required by that parameter file.

The scheduler allows several reconstructions to be executed one after the
other. It makes sure that there is never more that one reconstruction
executed by the HTTP interface (you might start a reconstruction manually,
but raytest does not recommend that).

The scheduler itself is a script located in /home/clearpet/scripts. In order
to close security holes, it must be owned by root and not accessible to
other users:
  chown root.root /home/clearpet/scripts/recons_scheduler.pl
  chmod 700 /home/clearpet/scripts/recons_scheduler.pl

The scheduler should be started when the system boots up. To do that,
a script must be installed from the boot folder inthe archive into the
/etc/init.d folder, and it must be registered in the system:
 cp boot/clearpet_scheduler /etc/init.d
 insserv clearpet_scheduler

After installation, you should start the scheduler manually with
  /etc/init.d/clearpet_scheduler start

You can check its status with
  /etc/init.d/clearpet_scheduler status
or stop it with
  /etc/init.d/clearpet_scheduler stop

Note: If the configuration file needs to be changed after the scheduler
has been started, you can force it to reload its configuration with
  /etc/init.d/clearpet_scheduler reload

8. Image result folder
----------------------
The software will put the resulting images into a fixed folder.
The name of the image can be specified in the user interface.

The folder can be anywhere. It makes sense to use a folder which is
accessible by all interested users. Here, we use /samba/Images as
an example.

First, create the folder, and make it writeable by the clearpet user:
mkdir /samba/Images
chown clearpet.users /samba/Images
chmow g+w /samba/Images

The software must now where the folder is located. The folder name must
be specified in the /etc/clearpet.conf file. Open the file in a test editor,
and locate the line containing the key name "ImageDir". Write the name
of your image directory there. Save the file.

After successful reconstruction, you will find your images in this folder.
