#TODO: in order to get a better access protection, remove the
# "Allow from all" line and replace it with a line like:
#   Allow from network.com			# allow access only from local subnet
#   Allow from host1,host2,host3	# allow access only from specific hosts
# Of course, you need to adapt the values for your site.
# And don't forget to reload Apache after saving changes, with "rcapache2 relaod".
