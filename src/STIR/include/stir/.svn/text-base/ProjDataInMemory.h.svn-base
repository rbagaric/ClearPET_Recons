/* Implementation note (KT)
   
   I first used the std::stringstream class (when available).
   However, this class currently has a problem that you cannot preallocate
   a buffer size. This means that when we write to the stringstream, it will
   grow piece by piece. For some implementations (i.e. those that keep the memory
   contiguous), this might mean multiple reallocations and copying of data.
   Of course, for 'smart' implementations of stringstream, this wouldn't happen.
   Still, I've decided to not take the risk, and always use old style strstream instead.

  It's not clear if strstream will ever disappear from C++, but in any case, it won't happen 
  very soon. Still, if you no longer have strstream, or don't want to use it, you can enable 
  the stringstream implementation by removing the next line.
