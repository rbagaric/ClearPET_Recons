/*!
  \brief Parent class for all leaves in a RegisteredObject hierarchy that
  do parsing of parameter files.
  \ingroup buildblock
  \see RegisteredObject for an explanation why you would use this class.
  
  RegisteredParsingObject::read_from_stream is implemented in terms of
  ParsingObject::parse.

  Requirements on the class \a Base:
  - It needs to be derived from RegisteredObject<Base>

  Requirements on the class \a Derived:
  - It needs to have a static member static const char * const \a registered_name
  - It needs to have a default constructor
  - It needs to be derived from \a RegisteredParsingObject<Derived,Base,Parent>

  Requirements on the class \a Parent:
  - It needs to be derived from ParsingObject
  - It needs to be derived from \a Base

  Use the 2 parameter form if there is no ParsingObject anywhere in the
  hierarchy yet. However, we recommend to immediately derive \a Base from
  ParsingObject. 

  \par How to add a leave to the registry at run-time.
  Constructing the hierarchy as above makes sure that everything is
  ready. However, the registry needs to be filled at run-time.
  This could be done with user selection of the desired leaves
  (based on their \a registered_name), or just by entering all leaves
  in the registry.

  A leave will be entered in the hierarchy by declaring a variable as
  follows:
  \code
   Derived::RegisterIt dummy;
  \endcode
  As soon as the variable is destructed, the leave will be taken out of
  the registry (but see todo). If you want to add it as long as the program runs, use 
  a static variable.

  Currently, STIR has static variables in files for each module
  (for instance, buildblock_registries.cxx). Note that these files
  have to be linked explicitly into your program, as opposed to
  sticking it in a library. This is because the linker will think that
  the variables in that file are never referenced, so would not include
  it in the final executable (to try to remove redundant object files).

      \a Derived*, but it seems the registration machinery would need extra 
      (unsafe) reinterpret_casts to get that to work.
      (TODO find a remedy).
