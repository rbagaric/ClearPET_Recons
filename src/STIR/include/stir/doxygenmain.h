 \section intro Introduction

 This is the documentation for STIR: Software for Tomographic
 Image Reconstruction. It is automatically
 generated by doxygen from text comments in the files.

 As the amount of software is rather large, some guidance is probably 
 needed. The best place to start is probably the Modules section. This
 attempts to group files in a sensible way. In particular, a User is
 probably only interested in the modules which contain executables 
 (not a library). 

 Another way to navigate through this is the Class Hierarchy page, or indeed
 any of the other alphabetical lists. 
 However, this is not structured at all, and even contains some classes
 which we'd rather not have in there. So, in the beginning, this might be 
 somewhat confusing.

 Other information (sometimes overlapping) is given in the User's Guide, and 
 the Software Architecture sections, available on the web-site.

 \section docproblems Problems to keep in mind when reading this documentation

 All documentation depends on the person who writes it. In the end, only 
 the code is what matters...
