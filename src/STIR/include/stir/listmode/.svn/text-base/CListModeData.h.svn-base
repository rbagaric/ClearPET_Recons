/*!
  \brief The base class for reading list mode data.
  \ingroup listmode

  \par What is list mode data?

  List mode data is a format for storing detected counts as a list, as
  opposed to a histogram. For each count, a list mode event contains
  all the properties that the scanner can give you. Hence, the
  list mode data gives you all the information about your acquisition
  that you can possibly get. Which information this is obviously depends
  on the scanner.

  For most (all?) scanners, events are stored in chronological order. 
  In addition to events, time flags are inserted into the list mode data.
  So, generally list mode data is a list of 'records', which can be
  of different types. In STIR, this concept of a 'record' corresponds to 
  the CListRecord class and its relatives (see the documentation for
  CListRecord).

  \par Usage
  
  For most applications, i.e. when one just wants to go through the list of
  all events, the code would be as follows:

  \code
  shared_ptr<CListModeData> lm_data_sptr =
    CListModeData::read_from_file(filename);

  // get a pointer to a 'template' record that will work for the scanner 
  // from which we're reading data
  shared_ptr <CListRecord> record_sptr = 
    lm_data_ptr->get_empty_record_sptr();
  // give the record a simple name to avoid cluttering the code below
  CListRecord& record = *record_sptr;

  double current_time = 0;
  while (lm_data_sptr->get_next_record(record) == Succeeded::yes) 
    {
      if (record.is_time())
      {
	current_time= record.time().get_time_in_secs();
      }
      if (record.is_event())
      {
        if (record.event().is_prompt())
	{ // do something 
        }
        // ...
      } 
    }
  \endcode

  In addition, there is a facility to 'remember' positions in the list,
  and go back to one of these positions. This could be useful to
  mark time frames. This goes as follows.

  \code
  // somehow I found out this is the start of the frame, so save it
  CListModeData::SavedPosition start_of_this_frame =
     lm_data_sptr->save_get_position();

  // now do something with this frame

  // now get back to the start of the frame
  if ( lm_data_sptr->set_get_position(start_of_this_frame)
     != Succeeded::yes)
    error("Help!");
  \endcode

  \todo Currently, this class (and CListRecord) is specific to PET, i.e. to
  coincidence detection (hence the 'C'). However, the only part that
  is not general are the functions related to prompts and delayeds.
  Potentially, we make classes ListModeData etc which would work for SPECT
  (and other count-based modalities?). Alternatively, SPECT can be
  handled by calling all single photon events 'prompts'.
  
  \par Notes for developers

  If you want to add a new type of list mode data, you have to make corresponding
  derived classes of CListModeData, CListRecord etc. You also have to modify
  CListModeData::read_from_file to recognise your data.

  \todo Use registry-based implementation of read_from_file.

      the same list mode data.

      The reason this cannot be guaranteed is largely in case the list mode data is 
      not really on disk, but the object corresponds for instance to a Monte Carlo simulator.

      This is determined by the SavedPosition type. Once you save more
      positions, the first positions will be overwritten. There is currently 
      no way of finding out after how many times this will happen (but it's
      a large number...).

      \warning These saved positions are only valid for the lifetime of the
