//! A base class for records in list mode formats where all event types have the same size
/*! \ingroup listmode
  Many list mode formats have event types (such as timing or coincidence 
  events) that are the same type. Typically such a record has then a few 
  bits that identify the type of the record. So, reading a record in the
  data stream consists of reading a fixed number of bits. The type of
  record can then be determined by checking the relevant type-bits.

  It is possible to encode records in such a list mode format using a class 
  derived from CListRecordUsingUnion. The advantage is that all such
  list mode formats can be read using CListModeDataFromStream.
  It is expected that the derived class
  contains a \c union for the different types. 
  CListModeDataFromStream::get_next_record() can then simply read a specified
  number of bits and store it at the address of that union.
    
  \see CListModeData for more info on list mode data.
